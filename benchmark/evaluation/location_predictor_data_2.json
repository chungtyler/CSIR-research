Start at **Lab** due to high relevance for testing and fixing equipment.\n2. Check **Storage Room** next, where he might be organizing cables.\n3. The **Meeting Room** could be relevant next for presentation setups.\n4. **Office** and **Lunch Room** are least likely but still checked at the end.\n\n### Final List\n<list>['lab', 'storage_room', 'meeting_room', 'office', 'lunch_room']</list>",

It's logical for him to be at the TV screen location or where the cables are stored.\n- **Context:** The TV screen display cables no longer work, suggesting he might be where repairs are needed (lab or meeting room) or retrieving cables (storage room).\n\n### Step 3: Optimize the Pathing Based on Relative Distances\n- **Start location to storage room:** Direct and relevant as Tyson may be retrieving cables.\n- **Storage Room to Meeting Room:** Storage is close to the meeting room, and it makes sense for him to be fixing or setting up there.\n- **Meeting Room to Lab:** If not found, then moving to the lab would be logical.\n- **Other locations (Office, Lunch Room):** Lower probability based on the context.\n\n### Step 4: Output the Finalized Ranked List\nBased on the above analysis, here's the optimized list to find Tyson:\n\n```xml\n<list> ['storage_room', 'meeting_room', 'lab', 'office', 'lunch_room'] </list>\n```",
